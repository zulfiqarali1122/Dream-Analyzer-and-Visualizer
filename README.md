#  Dream Analyzer and Visualizer

This project analyzes user-provided dream descriptions, extracts themes, and generates a realistic video visualization of the dream using AI-powered image generation techniques.

# Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Extracts themes, sentiment, and categories from dream descriptions.
AI Image Generation: Uses Stable Diffusion to create realistic images for dream themes.
Video Compilation: Combines generated images into a coherent video representation of the dream.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following:

Python 3.8+
CUDA-compatible GPU (optional for faster image generation)
Installed libraries (see requirements.txt)

#  Setup Instructions
Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
# Activate the environment:
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Step 3: Install Dependencies
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
Run the main script:

Copy code
python -m src.app
#  Enter your dream description when prompted.
The application will:
Analyze the dream description.
Generate images for the identified themes.
Create a video visualization of the dream.
The output video will be saved as dream_visualization.mp4 in the project directory.
