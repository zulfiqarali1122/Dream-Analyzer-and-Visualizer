Dream Analyzer and Visualizer
Welcome to the Dream Analyzer and Visualizer project! This application allows users to input their dream descriptions, analyze them using NLP techniques, and generate a realistic video visualization of the dream themes using AI-powered image generation models.

Features
Dream Analysis: Extracts themes, categories, and sentiment from the dream description.
AI-Powered Visualization: Generates ultra-realistic images for dream themes using Stable Diffusion.
Video Compilation: Combines images into a visually stunning video to represent the dream.
Demo
Run the project.
Enter a dream description (e.g., "I was floating above a tranquil ocean, the sun setting in the distance.").
Get a fully analyzed dream output along with a video representing your dream.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Clone or Download the Repository

Clone:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/zulfiqarali1122/dream-analyzer-visualizer.git
cd dream-analyzer-visualizer
Or manually download and extract the project files.
Create a Virtual Environment

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment

Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download Stable Diffusion Model

The Stable Diffusion model will be automatically downloaded when you run the project for the first time. Ensure you have at least 10GB of free space for the model files.
Usage
Run the application:
bash
Copy code
python -m src.app
Enter your dream description when prompted.
Wait for the application to analyze the dream and generate a video visualization.
Find the output video saved as dream_visualization.mp4 in the root directory.

Example
Input:

"I was floating above a tranquil ocean, the sun setting in the distance. The water shimmered in golden hues, and a gentle breeze brushed across my face."

Output:

Themes: floating, ocean, sunset, tranquility
Sentiment: Polarity = 0.05, Subjectivity = 0.37
Category: Adventure
Video: A serene video visualization of the dream.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
CUDA-compatible GPU (Optional for faster image generation)
Known Issues
Initial model download requires ~10GB of free space.
Running on CPU is slower than on GPU.
